            <h3>My Childhood</h3>
            <p>
                I had a simple and happy childhood where I spent most of my time playing with friends, 
                watching cartoons, and being with my family.
            </p>

            <h3>My Teenage Life</h3>
            <p>
                In my teenage years, I discovered interests like playing video games. 
                I also got into some trouble for skipping classes just to play at a computer shop.
                Ah~ the memories!.
            </p>

            <h3>My Adulthood</h3>
            <p>
                Now that Im older, I mostly spend my time playing video games and relaxing. 
                Ive become a bit lazier than before, but I still enjoy learning new things every now and then.

                <p>
                    This is Kendrick Lamar, a Hip-Hop artist. I like his music 
                    because it is bouncy, but at the same time it expresses 
                    real life stories.

                <p>
                    This is Japan. Japan is my favorite place because it looks peaceful and amazing.
                    I love the unique cherry blossoms, the sakura trees and the look of the city.

                <p>
                    This is sleeping. I can fall asleep anywhere and anytime. Sleeping helps me regain energy and think better.
